## SICP Exercises: Exercise solutions for 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs', by Abelson and Sussman.  
This repository contains solutions for exercises from the book 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs', by Abelson and Sussman. Exercises that require code to be written have been completed in original Scheme (using Racket with the #lang sicp declaration) and also in Haskell; in the Haskell solutions I have attempted to be as faithful to Scheme as possible, e.g. by utilising prefix operators using bracket notation. Exercises not requiring written code are presented in markdown files.
